# James Wedding Guest List
Guest list organizing web app for wedding

**Note:**
This project was part of the coursework for CSE 331 at the University of Washington. The majority of the framework was provided by the instructors.
My contributions were in:
- guest.ts
- guest_test.ts
- GuestEdit.tsx
- GuestList.tsx
- GuestNew.tsx
- WeddingApp.tsx
- routes.ts
- routes_test.ts

Developed a full-stack wep application using React and Node.js to manage wedding guest lists. Implemented core functionality on the client side: forms to add guests, edit guest details, customize dietary restrictions, and include plus-ones.

Wrote fetch logic to handle client-server communication and updated React components based on server response. Synced client and server state to ensure data persistence through browser reloads

**Features**
- Add guests and their plus-ones, labeled as the guest(s) of either bride or groom
- Guests can be labeled as family
- Approximation of total guests
- Dietary restrictions for each guest
